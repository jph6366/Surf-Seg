# 3D Surface Segmentation

This is a repo containing code to to analyze a list of 3D triangles, find the number N of
disconnected closed surfaces and visualize the result as N surfaces where each surface is
rendered in a different color. I compare the use of Octrees and KDTrees to perform a 
nearest neighbor search using built-in VTK and PCL libraries.
